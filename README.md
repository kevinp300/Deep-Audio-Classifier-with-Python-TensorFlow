# Deep-Audio-Classifier-with-Python-TensorFlow
In this project, I aimed to predict if an audio file contains a Capuchin bird call. I was responsible for preprocessing audio files, converting them to their spectrogram representation, and training a convolutional neural network (CNN) using TensorFlow and the Keras library. I implemented several layers of 2D convolutional layers, dense layers, and an output layer with a sigmoid activation function. I trained the model using the Adam optimizer and Binary Cross-Entropy loss function, and evaluated the model using recall and precision metrics.
